  "1d36ab5d6b": "Dryer balls are supposed to help. When they’re in the machine, they slacken the clothes, making them dry faster. Forty percent faster, if the manufacturers are to be believed. At the same time, the felt balls are designed to replace fabric softener. That’s because the fibres of your clothes have more room to stand on end instead of getting tangled up in each other. As a result, the laundry’s static charge is supposedly reduced, too. And all this using zero chemicals, only felted wool. So, does it work?",
  "703877197b": "Fortunately, I’ve just washed and spin-dried three hand towels. Instead of draping them over my tower-like drying rack as usual, I leave them in the machine and throw in the required minimum of three balls too. I set the dial on the machine to «dry, strong», which immediately causes a red «20» to appear in the «duration» display window. As I’ve been promised a time saving of forty percent, I just decide to set it to «40». As soon as I start the drying cycle, the «40» morphs into a «43». Magic. And the less magic thing? The drying balls. Although, that’s not to say they don’t work. After the machine beeps, my clothes are still damp, but are nevertheless about as dry as they would be after a 70-minute cycle minus the balls. So as not to put more pressure on the environment, or a natural gas market that’s complicated to say the least (yep, everything at my place runs on gas: the heating, the stove and the washing machine), I hang the towels on the rack for the final stretch after all. The balls, on the other, can just be left to dry on top of the washing machine – they’re not noticeably damp.",

The term crowdworking covers a wide variety of activities from technical services provided in situ, passenger transport, cleaning services, data processing through to copywriting and software testing etc. The only common feature is that the activity is arranged through an online platform or mobile application. Provided that particular prerequisites are met, crowdworking is subject to the same legal requirements as self-employed work and does not give rise to any ongoing employment relationship entailing liability for social insurance contributions. Whilst crowdworking is performed in many countries primarily as a secondary job or on a part-time basis, there are crowdworkers who already use this form of work as their principal source of income. Alongside the financial incentives, there are also other significant reasons for carrying out this type of work, such as a passion for passing on knowledge or expertise, engaging in a pastime or simply due to altruistic considerations. Crowdworking is characterised by its considerable degree of flexibility. Crowdworkers are free to decide on various platforms whether or not to accept a job. In addition, on some platforms they are largely free to manage their time. However, platform operators are unable to guarantee work, since demand is determined by the market.",

As an intermediary, Completely Professional providers account of the timescales and deadlines required by the customer, although also ensures that orders are planned realistically and that the crowdworker has sufficient time in order to complete his/her service.

Cleaning has become a very important service for the growth and development of economic relations. However, the illegal trade in cleaning services has serious effects on the industry, the economy and society. The black market industry in the cleaning industry is a direct threat to the security and stability of the industry, as well as the risks it poses to a country’s economy.

  "2934931ba0": "Ironically, it is cheaper and more affordable for people who are looking to get illegal substances to do so through the black market.

Illegal companies do not need to comply with the law due to the fact that they are not registered. This means that they are free from all of the fees and taxes to which legal companies must adhere. These fees and taxes can be as simple as government generated fines or as complex as the cost of having permits, licences and various other documents. An illegal substance dealer can offer cheaper prices because they do not need to cover the expenses of being a legally registered business. Illegal companies are often able to undercut legal competitors because of all of the additional costs they do not have to pay.",

This can lead to injury and property damage. Another major issue is that their work can be done in an unsanitary way. If you have ever had someone clean your home or office and they use toxic chemicals that are not used safely, you can easily see the issue with this.",
  "bedc092885": "Moreover, with the black market being so high in the cleaning industry, there are many cases of companies being left out of the loop on training, certifications and other important things that make the cleaning industry run smoothly and safely. This is due to the association with the black market and not having enough resources to give their staff the tools that they need to be able to operate properly. This can lead to accidents and property damage when the companies are not able to complete their work properly.",
  "434a825ccd": "The black market industry in the cleaning industry is essentially, a scam. Let’s say someone likes their current cleaning service, but their price is too high, so they decide to go to a cheaper business. The price is so low that it is essentially, free. The customer thinks they’re getting a deal, but they’re essentially paying for substandard service that often results in their home being in worse condition than before they hired the service. They are also supporting an illegal business that doesn’t pay taxes. This type of company preys upon the customers’ desire to receive services at a lower price. Those who hire cleaning services are often taken advantage of in this way. Those who hire illegal workers are essentially, supporting a human trafficking ring. This is because many illegal workers are brought over to another country under false pretenses and are often trapped in the industry with no way out. They are often exploited and do not receive fair pay while being forced to work in inhumane conditions.",
